# python-rebootRemoteserver-ping-action
This script using python3, it is connecting to remote server using IP address and running some actions(FIO in my case), then sending reboot and doing ping until get response. once server responds it will do the same thing again. It is a good script to do reboot + fio testing
Also on boot if some specific thing happening on drive it will send SMS over phone
